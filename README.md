Description:

The goal of this challenge was to create a simple work day scheduler. I was able to accomplish this by creating HTML elements dynamically with the use of third party APIs such as jQuery and Moment.js for the time components. The other piece is taking advantage of local storage to set key value pairs tied to each time-block text area. To accomplish this piece there is a save button beside each row to set the key value pairs, along with an initialization function that is evoked immediately to pull any values currently in local storage into the corresponding HTML elements.
